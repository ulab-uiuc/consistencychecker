      Given a list of integers, find the longest increasing subsequence of alternating
      sum.

      A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting
      some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

      The alternating sum of a sequence is the sum of its elements with alternating
      signs.

    description: '**Maximum Minimum Path Sum**

      ===========

      You are given a directed graph where each node has a weight associated with
      it.

      The graph is represented as a list of edges, where each edge is a tuple of two
      nodes and a weight.

      The goal is to find the maximum minimum path sum in the graph, i.e., the maximum
      sum of the minimum weights of all paths from a node to all other nodes.

      ===========

      **Example 1:**

      Input: edges = [(1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 3)]

      Output: 5

      Explanation: The maximum minimum path sum is 5, which is the minimum weight
      of the path (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4) and (1 -> 3 -> 4).

      **Example 2:**

      Input: edges = [(1, 2, 1), (2, 3, 2), (3, 4, 1), (4, 5, 3)]

      Output: 4

      Explanation: The maximum minimum path sum is 4, which is the minimum weight
      of the path (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4).

    description: '**The Infinite Labyrinth of Reflections**

      You are given a 2D grid of integers, where each cell contains a positive integer.

      The grid is surrounded by an infinite reflecting boundary.

      You are standing at the top-left corner of the grid, and you want to find the
      minimum number of steps it takes to reach the bottom-right corner.

      However, there''s a catch: the grid is not just a simple grid, but a grid of
      reflections.

      Each cell in the grid reflects the contents of the cell at the opposite corner
      of the grid.

      In other words, if the cell at (i, j) contains the value x, then the cell at
      (n-i-1, n-j-1) also contains the value x, where n is the size of the grid.

      You can move up, down, left, or right in the grid, but you cannot move diagonally.

      You can only move to a cell that contains a value that is not reflected in the
      cell you are currently in.

      Your goal is to find the minimum number of steps it takes to reach the bottom-right
      corner of the grid.

      Given a directed graph where each node has a value and an edge has a weight,
      find the minimum cost to traverse from a source node to a sink node. The graph

    description: '# 77778: Fastest Path to 1000 Points on a Weighted Graph


      You are given a weighted graph G = (V, E) with n nodes and m edges, where each
      edge (u, v) has a weight w. You are also given a starting node s and a target
      number of points, 1000.


      Your goal is to find the fastest path from node s to any node v in the graph
      such that the sum of the weights of the edges in the path is at most 1000. If
      no such path exists, return -1.


      The graph can be represented as an adjacency list, where each node i is associated
      with a list of edges (j, w) representing the edge from node i to node j with
      weight w.


      You should implement a function `main` that takes as input the graph, the starting
      node, and the target number of points, and returns the fastest path and the
      total weight of the path.


      The function should run in O(m log n) time complexity, where m is the number
      of edges and n is the number of nodes.


      Example inputs and outputs:


      - `main([[1, 2, 1], [2, 3, 3], [1, 3, 2]], 1, 4)` returns (3, 2)

      - `main([[1, 2, 10], [2, 3, 20]], 1, 10)` returns (2, 10)

      - `main([[1, 2, 10], [2, 3, 20]], 1, 5)` returns -1

    description: '**The Cosmic String Theory Problem**

      You are given a list of `n` points in 3D space, each represented by a tuple
      of three integers `(x, y, z)`. Your task is to find the maximum number of points
      that can be covered by a set of `k` spheres, where each sphere has a fixed radius
      of `r`. The points are considered covered by a sphere if they lie within a distance
      of `r` from the center of the sphere.

      For example, if we have the points `(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9)` and `k
      = 2, r = 3`, one possible solution is to place two spheres at `(1, 2, 3)` and
      `(4, 5, 6)`, covering a total of 3 points.

      The input list of points may contain duplicate points, and the output should
      be the maximum number of points that can be covered by the spheres. The points
      are guaranteed to be non-empty and the input list will not be empty.


      For example:

      ```

      Input: points = [(1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9)], k = 2, r = 3

      Output: 3

      ```

    description: '**Problem: Fast Fourier Transform with Modular Arithmetic**


      Given a list of integers `A` and a prime number `p`, compute the Fast Fourier
      Transform (FFT) of `A` modulo `p`. The FFT is a fast and efficient algorithm
      for computing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence.


      The DFT of a sequence `A` is a sequence of complex numbers that represents the
      distribution of the original sequence in the frequency domain.


      The input list `A` is of length `n`, and the prime number `p` is given.


      The output should be a list of complex numbers representing the FFT of `A` modulo
      `p`.


      **Example:**


      Input: `A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `p = 7`

      Output: `[4, 5, 6, 1, 2]`

      * `1 <= n <= 10^6`

      * `1 <= p <= 10^9`

    description: '**Longest Palindromic Subsequence with Consecutive Deletions**

      ===


      Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, find the length of the longest palindromic
      subsequence in `s` that can be obtained by deleting at most `k` characters.


      A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting
      some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.


      Example 1:

      Input: `s = "abracadabra", k = 2`

      Output: `5`

      Explanation: The longest palindromic subsequence is "abbra".


      Example 2:

      Input: `s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", k = 25`

      Output: `26`

      Explanation: The longest palindromic subsequence is the entire string.


      Example 3:

      Input: `s = "aabbcc", k = 0`

      Output: `4`

      Explanation: The longest palindromic subsequence is "aabb".
