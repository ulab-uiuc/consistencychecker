  description: '**Longest Increasing Subsequence with Wildcard**

    ===


    Given an array of integers `nums` and a wildcard character `?`, find the length
    of the longest increasing subsequence that can be formed by replacing some or
    no elements of `nums` with `?`.


    A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting
    some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.


    The wildcard `?` can be used as any integer, positive or negative.


    Example 1:

    Input: `nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], ? = 2`

    Output: 5

    Explanation: Replace the first 2 with ?, then the subsequence is [?, 2, 3, 4,
    5, 6].


    Example 2:

    Input: `nums = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6], ? = 3`

    Output: 4

    Explanation: Replace the first 2 with ?, then the subsequence is [?, 3, 4, 5,
    6].


    Example 3:

    Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], ? = 6`

    Output: 5

    Explanation: No need to replace any elements, the subsequence is [1, 2, 3, 4,
    5].


    Example 4:

    Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], ? = 1`

    Output: 1

    Explanation: Replace all elements with ?, then the subsequence is [?, ?, ?, ?,
    ?, ?].


    Example 5:

    Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], ? = 10`

    Output: 6

    Explanation: Replace all elements with ?, then the subsequence is [?, ?, ?, ?,
    ?, ?].


    Example 6:

    Input: `nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], ? = 1`

    Output: 7

    Explanation: Replace all elements with ?, then the subsequence is [?, ?, ?, ?,
    ?, ?, ?].


    Example 7:

    Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], ? = 7`

    Output: 6

    Explanation: No need to replace any elements, the subsequence is [1, 2, 3, 4,
    5, 6].


    Example 8:

    Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], ? = 0`

    Output: 6

    5, 6].


    Example 9:

    Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], ? = -1`

    Output: 6

    Explanation: No need to replace any elements, the subsequence is [1, 2, 3, 4,

    Output: 6

    Explanation: No need to replace any elements, the subsequence is [1, 2, 3, 4,

        ===


        Given an array of integers `nums` and a wildcard character `?`, find the length
        of the longest increasing subsequence that can be formed by replacing some
        or no elements of `nums` with `?`.


        A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting
        some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.


        The wildcard `?` can be used as any integer, positive or negative.


        Example 1:

        Input: `nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], ? = 2`

        ===


        Given an array of integers `nums` and a wildcard character `?`, find the length
        of the longest increasing subsequence that can be formed by replacing some
        or no elements of `nums` with `?`.


        A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting
        some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.


        The wildcard `?` can be used as any integer, positive or negative.


        Example 1:

        Input: `nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], ? = 2`

        Output: 5

        Explanation: Replace the first 2 with ?, then the subsequence is [?, 2, 3,
        4, 5, 6].

      description: '**Longest Increasing Subsequence with Wildcard**

        ===


        Given an array of integers `nums` and a wildcard character `?`, find the length
        of the longest increasing subsequence that can be formed by replacing some
        or no elements of `nums` with `?`.


        A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting
        some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.


        The wildcard `?` can be used as any integer, positive or negative.


        Example 1:

        Input: `nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], ? = 2`

        Output: 5

        Explanation: Replace the first 2 with ?, then the subsequence is [?, 2, 3,
        4, 5, 6].


        Example 2:

        Input: `nums = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6], ? = 3`

        Output: 4

        Explanation: Replace the first 2 with ?, then the subsequence is [?, 3, 4,
        5, 6].


        Example 3:

        Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], ? = 6`

        Output: 5

        Explanation: No need to replace any elements, the subsequence is [1, 2, 3,
        4, 5].


        Example 4:

        Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], ? = 1`

        Output: 1

        Explanation: Replace all elements with ?, then the subsequence is [?, ?, ?,
        ?, ?, ?].


        Example 5:

        Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], ? = 10`

        Output: 6

        Explanation: Replace all elements with ?, then the subsequence is [?, ?, ?,
        ?, ?, ?].


        Example 6:

        Input: `nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], ? = 1`

        Output: 7

        Explanation: Replace all elements with ?, then the subsequence is [?, ?, ?,
        ?, ?, ?, ?].


        Example 7:

        Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], ? = 7`

        Output: 6

        Explanation: No need to replace any elements, the subsequence is [1, 2, 3,
        4, 5, 6].


        Example 8:

        Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], ? = 0`

        Output: 6

        4, 5, 6].


        Example 9:

        Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], ? = -1`

        Output: 6

        Explanation: No need to replace any elements, the subsequence is [1, 2, 3,
        4, 5, 6].
