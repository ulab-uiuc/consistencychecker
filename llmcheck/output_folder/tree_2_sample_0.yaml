  description: '**Maximum Flow in a Directed Graph with Multiple Sources and Sinks**

    Given a directed graph with multiple sources and sinks, find the maximum flow
    that can be pushed from the sources to the sinks.

    The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, where `graph[i][j]` represents
    the capacity of the edge from node `i` to node `j`.

    The sources are represented as a list of node indices, and the sinks are represented
    as a list of node indices.

    The maximum flow is the maximum amount of flow that can be pushed from the sources
    to the sinks without exceeding the capacity of any edge.

      description: '**Maximum Flow in a Directed Graph with Multiple Sources and Sinks**

        Given a directed graph with multiple sources and sinks, find the maximum flow
        that can be pushed from the sources to the sinks.

        The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, where `graph[i][j]` represents
        the capacity of the edge from node `i` to node `j`.

        The sources are represented as a list of node indices, and the sinks are represented
        as a list of node indices.

        The maximum flow is the maximum amount of flow that can be pushed from the
        sources to the sinks without exceeding the capacity of any edge.

      description: '**Maximum Flow in a Directed Graph with Multiple Sources and Sinks**

        Given a directed graph with multiple sources and sinks, find the maximum flow
        that can be pushed from the sources to the sinks.

        The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, where `graph[i][j]` represents
        the capacity of the edge from node `i` to node `j`.

        The sources are represented as a list of node indices, and the sinks are represented
        as a list of node indices.

        The maximum flow is the maximum amount of flow that can be pushed from the
        sources to the sinks without exceeding the capacity of any edge.

      description: '**Maximum Flow in a Directed Graph with Multiple Sources and Sinks**

        Given a directed graph with multiple sources and sinks, find the maximum flow
        that can be pushed from the sources to the sinks.

        The graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, where `graph[i][j]` represents
        the capacity of the edge from node `i` to node `j`.

        The sources are represented as a list of node indices, and the sinks are represented
        as a list of node indices.

        The maximum flow is the maximum amount of flow that can be pushed from the
        sources to the sinks without exceeding the capacity of any edge.
