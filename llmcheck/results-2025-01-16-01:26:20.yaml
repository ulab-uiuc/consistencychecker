  description: "# 1414. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram\nAn anagram\
    \ of a string is another string that contains the same characters, \nonly rearranged.\
    \ For example, the anagrams of \"listen\" are \"silent\" and \"enlist\" \nand\
    \ \"tinsel\". Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, determine if s2\
    \ \nis an anagram of s1. If it's not, find the minimum number of characters you\
    \ need \nto change to make s2 an anagram of s1. The minimum number of changes\
    \ is the \nminimum number of changes you need to make to s1 to make it an anagram\
    \ of s2.\n\n**Example 1:**\n\n* Input: s1 = \"bank\", s2 = \"kanb\"\n* Output:\
    \ 1\n* Note: You can make \"bank\" an anagram of \"kanb\" by changing 'a' to 'k'.\n\
    \n**Example 2:**\n\n* Input: s1 = \"hello\", s2 = \"bello\"\n* Output: 2\n* Note:\
    \ You can make \"hello\" an anagram of \"bello\" by changing 'h' to 'b' and 'e'\
    \ to 'o'.\n"
