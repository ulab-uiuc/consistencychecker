  description: '# Minimum Time to Fill All Ponds

    You are given a 2D array `heights` representing a landscape with ponds. Each cell
    `heights[i][j]` represents the height of the land at that position. When it rains,
    water fills the ponds, and you want to find the minimum time it takes to fill
    all the ponds.


    A pond is considered filled if the water level is at or above the height of the
    land at that position. Water flows from higher positions to lower positions, and
    it takes one unit of time to fill a pond.


    You are also given a list of `sources` representing the positions of the water
    sources. Each source is represented as a list `[i, j]`, where `i` is the row and
    `j` is the column of the source.


    The water from each source flows to the adjacent positions (up, down, left, right)
    if the height of the land at the adjacent position is lower than the height of
    the land at the source position.


    Your task is to find the minimum time it takes to fill all the ponds.

            You are given a 2D array `heights` representing a landscape with ponds.
            Each cell `heights[i][j]` represents the height of the land at that position.
            When it rains, water fills the ponds, and you want to find the minimum
            time it takes to fill all the ponds.


            A pond is considered filled if the water level is at or above the height
            of the land at that position. Water flows from higher positions to lower
            positions, and it takes one unit of time to fill a pond.


            You are also given a list of `sources` representing the positions of the
            water sources. Each source is represented as a list `[i, j]`, where `i`
            is the row and `j` is the column of the source.


            The water from each source flows to the adjacent positions (up, down,
            left, right) if the height of the land at the adjacent position is lower
            than the height of the land at the source position.

          description: '# Minimum Time to Fill All Ponds

            You are given a 2D array `heights` representing a landscape with ponds.
            Each cell `heights[i][j]` represents the height of the land at that position.
            When it rains, water fills the ponds, and you want to find the minimum
            time it takes to fill all the ponds.


            A pond is considered filled if the water level is at or above the height
            of the land at that position. Water flows from higher positions to lower
            positions, and it takes one unit of time to fill a pond.


            You are also given a list of `sources` representing the positions of the
            water sources. Each source is represented as a list `[i, j]`, where `i`
            is the row and `j` is the column of the source.


            The water from each source flows to the adjacent positions (up, down,
            left, right) if the height of the land at the adjacent position is lower
            than the height of the land at the source position.


            Your task is to find the minimum time it takes to fill all the ponds.

            description: '# Minimum Time to Fill All Ponds

              You are given a 2D array `heights` representing a landscape with ponds.
              Each cell `heights[i][j]` represents the height of the land at that
              position. When it rains, water fills the ponds, and you want to find
              the minimum time it takes to fill all the ponds.


              A pond is considered filled if the water level is at or above the height
              of the land at that position. Water flows from higher positions to lower
              positions, and it takes one unit of time to fill a pond.


              You are also given a list of `sources` representing the positions of
              the water sources. Each source is represented as a list `[i, j]`, where
              `i` is the row and `j` is the column of the source.


              The water from each source flows to the adjacent positions (up, down,
              left, right) if the height of the land at the adjacent position is lower
              than the height of the land at the source position.


              Your task is to find the minimum time it takes to fill all the ponds.

            description: '# Minimum Time to Fill All Ponds

              You are given a 2D array `heights` representing a landscape with ponds.
              Each cell `heights[i][j]` represents the height of the land at that
              position. When it rains, water fills the ponds, and you want to find
              the minimum time it takes to fill all the ponds.


              A pond is considered filled if the water level is at or above the height
              of the land at that position. Water flows from higher positions to lower
              positions, and it takes one unit of time to fill a pond.


              You are also given a list of `sources` representing the positions of
              the water sources. Each source is represented as a list `[i, j]`, where
              `i` is the row and `j` is the column of the source.


              The water from each source flows to the adjacent positions (up, down,
              left, right) if the height of the land at the adjacent position is lower
              than the height of the land at the source position.


              Your task is to find the minimum time it takes to fill all the ponds.

            description: '# Minimum Time to Fill All Ponds

              You are given a 2D array `heights` representing a landscape with ponds.
              Each cell `heights[i][j]` represents the height of the land at that
              position. When it rains, water fills the ponds, and you want to find
              the minimum time it takes to fill all the ponds.


              A pond is considered filled if the water level is at or above the height
              of the land at that position. Water flows from higher positions to lower
              positions, and it takes one unit of time to fill a pond.


              You are also given a list of `sources` representing the positions of
              the water sources. Each source is represented as a list `[i, j]`, where
              `i` is the row and `j` is the column of the source.


              The water from each source flows to the adjacent positions (up, down,
              left, right) if the height of the land at the adjacent position is lower
              than the height of the land at the source position.


              Your task is to find the minimum time it takes to fill all the ponds.
