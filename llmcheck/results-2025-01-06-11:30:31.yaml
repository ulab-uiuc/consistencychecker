  description: "## Longest Consecutive Increasing Subsequence\n\nGiven an unsorted\
    \ array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive increasing subsequence.\n\
    \nA consecutive increasing subsequence is defined as a sequence of integers where\
    \ each integer is exactly one greater than the previous integer in the sequence.\
    \ For example, [1, 2, 3] is a valid consecutive increasing subsequence, while\
    \ [1, 3, 2] is not.\n\nYour task is to implement a function that returns the length\
    \ of the longest consecutive increasing subsequence found in the input array.\n\
    \n### Example 1:\nInput: `[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`  \nOutput: `4`  \nExplanation:\
    \ The longest consecutive increasing subsequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.\n\n### Example\

    \ The longest consecutive increasing subsequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,\
    \ 9, 10]`.\n\n### Constraints:\n- The input array may contain duplicates.\n- The\
    \ length of the input array can be up to `10^5`.\n"
