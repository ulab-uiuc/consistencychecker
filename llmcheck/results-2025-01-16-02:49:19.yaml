  description: '## Optimal Meeting Scheduling with Conflict Resolution


    Given a list of meeting intervals with their respective priorities, schedule the
    meetings in a way that maximizes the total priority while avoiding conflicts.
    Each meeting interval is represented as a tuple of two integers, where the first
    integer is the start time and the second integer is the end time. The priority
    of each meeting is represented as an integer. If two meetings conflict, the meeting
    with the higher priority is chosen.


    Example 1:


    Input: intervals = [[0, 30, 1], [5, 10, 2], [15, 20, 3]], n = 3

    Output: [[0, 30, 1], [15, 20, 3]]

    Explanation: The meeting from 0 to 30 has a priority of 1, the meeting from 5
    to 10 has a priority of 2, and the meeting from 15 to 20 has a priority of 3.
    We choose the meetings from 0 to 30 and from 15 to 20 because they have the highest
    total priority and do not conflict.


    Example 2:


    Input: intervals = [[0, 30, 1], [5, 10, 2], [15, 20, 3], [25, 40, 4]], n = 4

    Output: [[0, 30, 1], [25, 40, 4]]

    Explanation: The meeting from 0 to 30 has a priority of 1, the meeting from 5
    to 10 has a priority of 2, the meeting from 15 to 20 has a priority of 3, and
    the meeting from 25 to 40 has a priority of 4. We choose the meetings from 0 to
    30 and from 25 to 40 because they have the highest total priority and do not conflict.

          Each meeting interval is represented as a tuple of two integers, where the

          The priority of each meeting is represented as an integer. If two meetings

          description: '## Optimal Meeting Scheduling with Conflict Resolution


            Given a list of meeting intervals with their respective priorities, schedule
            the meetings in a way that maximizes the total priority while avoiding
            conflicts. Each meeting interval is represented as a tuple of two integers,
            where the first integer is the start time and the second integer is the
            end time. The priority of each meeting is represented as an integer. If
            two meetings conflict, the meeting with the higher priority is chosen.


            Example 1:


            Input: intervals = [[0, 30, 1], [5, 10, 2], [15, 20, 3]], n = 3

            Output: [[0, 30, 1], [15, 20, 3]]

            Explanation: The meeting from 0 to 30 has a priority of 1, the meeting
            from 5 to 10 has a priority of 2, and the meeting from 15 to 20 has a
            priority of 3. We choose the meetings from 0 to 30 and from 15 to 20 because
            they have the highest total priority and do not conflict.


            Example 2:


            Input: intervals = [[0, 30, 1], [5, 10, 2], [15, 20, 3], [25, 40, 4]],
            n = 4

            Output: [[0, 30, 1], [25, 40, 4]]

            Explanation: The meeting from 0 to 30 has a priority of 1, the meeting
            from 5 to 10 has a priority of 2, the meeting from 15 to 20 has a priority
            of 3, and the meeting from 25 to 40 has a priority of 4. We choose the
            meetings from 0 to 30 and from 25 to 40 because they have the highest
            total priority and do not conflict.

        description: '## Optimal Meeting Scheduling with Conflict Resolution


          Given a list of meeting intervals with their respective priorities, schedule
          the meetings in a way that maximizes the total priority while avoiding conflicts.
          Each meeting interval is represented as a tuple of two integers, where the
          first integer is the start time and the second integer is the end time.
          The priority of each meeting is represented as an integer. If two meetings
          conflict, the meeting with the higher priority is chosen.


          Example 1:


          Input: intervals = [[0, 30, 1], [5, 10, 2], [15, 20, 3]], n = 3

          Output: [[0, 30, 1], [15, 20, 3]]

          Explanation: The meeting from 0 to 30 has a priority of 1, the meeting from
          5 to 10 has a priority of 2, and the meeting from 15 to 20 has a priority
          of 3. We choose the meetings from 0 to 30 and from 15 to 20 because they
          have the highest total priority and do not conflict.


          Example 2:


          Input: intervals = [[0, 30, 1], [5, 10, 2], [15, 20, 3], [25, 40, 4]], n
          = 4

          Output: [[0, 30, 1], [25, 40, 4]]

          Explanation: The meeting from 0 to 30 has a priority of 1, the meeting from
          5 to 10 has a priority of 2, the meeting from 15 to 20 has a priority of
          3, and the meeting from 25 to 40 has a priority of 4. We choose the meetings
          from 0 to 30 and from 25 to 40 because they have the highest total priority
          and do not conflict.

              avoiding conflicts. Each meeting interval is represented as a tuple
              of two integers, where the first integer is the start time and the second
              integer is the end time. The priority of each meeting is represented
              as an integer. If two meetings conflict, the meeting with the higher
              priority is chosen.


              Example 1:


              Input: intervals = [[0, 30, 1], [5, 10, 2], [15, 20, 3]], n = 3

              Output: [[0, 30, 1], [15, 20, 3]]

              Explanation: The meeting from 0 to 30 has a priority of 1, the meeting
              from 5 to 10 has a priority of 2, and the meeting from 15 to 20 has
              a priority of 3. We choose the meetings from 0 to 30 and from 15 to
              20 because they have the highest total priority and do not conflict.


              Example 2:


              Input: intervals = [[0, 30, 1], [5, 10, 2], [15, 20, 3], [25, 40, 4]],
              n = 4

              Output: [[0, 30, 1], [25, 40, 4]]

              Explanation: The meeting from 0 to 30 has a priority of 1, the meeting
              from 5 to 10 has a priority of 2, the meeting from 15 to 20 has a priority
              of 3, and the meeting from 25 to 40 has a priority of 4. We choose the
              meetings from 0 to 30 and from 25 to 40 because they have the highest
              total priority and do not conflict.

              Given a list of meeting intervals with their respective priorities,
              schedule the meetings in a way that maximizes the total priority while
              avoiding conflicts. Each meeting interval is represented as a tuple
              of two integers, where the first integer is the start time and the second
              integer is the end time. The priority of each meeting is represented
              as an integer. If two meetings conflict, the meeting with the higher
              priority is chosen.
