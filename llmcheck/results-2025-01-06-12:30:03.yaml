  description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

    Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers from
    the array.

    A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


    **Example 1:**

    Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

    Output: `6`

    Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


    **Example 2:**

    Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

    Output: `4`

    Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only use each
    number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then `2*2*4 = 16` but we
    can only use each number once, so the maximum product is `1*2*4 = 8` and then
    `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2
    = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


    **Example 3:**

    Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

    Output: `0`

    Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


    **Example 4:**

    Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

    Output: `0`

    Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


    **Example 5:**

    Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

    Output: `0`

    Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


    **Example 6:**

    Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

    Output: `-2`

    Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


    **Example 7:**

    Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

    Output: `-2`

    Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


    **Example 8:**

    Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

    Output: `0`

    Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


    **Example 9:**

    Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0,0]`

    Output: `-2`

    Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


    **Example 10:**

    Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

    Output: `0`

    Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


    **Example 11:**

    Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

    Output: `60`

    Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use each number
    more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we
    can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
    then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once,
    so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 =
    8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
    = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the
    maximum product is `60`


    **Example 12:**

    Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

    Output: `-6`

    Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can use each number
    more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8`
    but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3
    = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15`
    and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so the maximum product is `20`


    **Example 13:**

    Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

    Output: `1`

    Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


    **Example 14:**

    Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

    Output: `-1`

    Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use each number
    more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so
    the maximum product is `1`


    **Example 15:**

    Input: `nums = [-1,-1,-1]`

    Output: `-1`

    Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*-1 = 1`


    **Example 16:**

    Input: `nums = [1,1,1]`

    Output: `1`

    Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`

          Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
          from the array.

          A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


          **Example 1:**

          Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

          **Example 2:**

          Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

          Output: `4`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only use
          each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then `2*2*4
          = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product is `1*2*4
          = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and then `1*(-2)*4
          = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum product is
          `8` and finally we get `4`


          **Example 3:**

          Output: `60`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use each
          number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `1*2*4
          = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is
          `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
          number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*5
          = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
          the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5
          = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum product is `60`

          Output: `-6`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can use
          each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then
          `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
          product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4 =
          12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so the maximum product
          is `20`


          **Example 13:**

          Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

          Output: `1`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


          **Example 14:**

          Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

          Output: `-1`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use each
          number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and then `-1*-1*1
          = 1` so the maximum product is `1`


          **Example 15:**

        description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

          Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
          from the array.

          A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


          **Example 1:**

          Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

          Output: `6`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


          **Example 2:**

          Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

          Output: `4`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only use
          each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then `2*2*4
          = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product is `1*2*4
          = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and then `1*(-2)*4
          = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum product is
          `8` and finally we get `4`


          **Example 3:**

          Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

          Output: `0`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


          **Example 4:**

          Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

          Output: `0`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


          **Example 5:**

          Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

          Output: `0`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


          **Example 6:**

          Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

          Output: `-2`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


          **Example 7:**

          Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

          Output: `-2`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


          **Example 8:**

          Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

          Output: `0`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


          **Example 9:**

          Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0,0]`

          Output: `-2`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


          **Example 10:**

          Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

          Output: `0`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


          **Example 11:**

          Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

          Output: `60`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use each
          number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `1*2*4
          = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is
          `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
          number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*5
          = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
          the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5
          = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum product is `60`


          **Example 12:**

          Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

          Output: `-6`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can use
          each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then
          `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
          product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4 =
          12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so the maximum product
          is `20`


          **Example 13:**

          Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

          Output: `1`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


          **Example 14:**

          Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

          Output: `-1`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use each
          number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and then `-1*-1*1
          = 1` so the maximum product is `1`


          **Example 15:**

          Input: `nums = [-1,-1,-1]`

          Output: `-1`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*-1 = 1`


          **Example 16:**

          Input: `nums = [1,1,1]`

          Output: `1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use

              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`

              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

            Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
            from the array.

            A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


            **Example 1:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

            Output: `6`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


            **Example 2:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

            Output: `4`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
            use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then `2*2*4
            = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product is
            `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and then
            `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum
            product is `8` and finally we get `4`


            **Example 3:**

            Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

            Output: `0`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


            **Example 4:**

            Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

            Output: `0`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


            **Example 5:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

            Output: `0`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


            **Example 6:**

            Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

            Output: `-2`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`

            Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

            Output: `60`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
            `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
            product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
            we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
            = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number
            more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4
            = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum product
            is `60`


            **Example 12:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

            Output: `-6`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and
            then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the
            maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4
            = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so the maximum
            product is `20`


            **Example 13:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

            Output: `1`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


            **Example 14:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

            Output: `-1`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and then
            `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`

              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5

              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so

              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

            Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
            from the array.

            A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


            **Example 1:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

            `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum
            product is `8` and finally we get `4`


            **Example 3:**

            `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum

            we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5

            more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4
            = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum product
            is `60`


            **Example 12:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

            Output: `-6`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can use

            then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the
            maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4

              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`

              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then

              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.

              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5

              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then

              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5

              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then

              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

            Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
            from the array.

            A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


            **Example 1:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

            `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 7:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 9:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 10:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,-1]`

              Output: `-1`

              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 9:**

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

            description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

          Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
          from the array.

          A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


          **Example 1:**

          Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

          Output: `6`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


          **Example 2:**

          Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

          Output: `4`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only use
          each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then `2*2*4
          = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product is `1*2*4
          = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and then `1*(-2)*4
          = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum product is
          `8` and finally we get `4`


          **Example 3:**

          Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

          Output: `0`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


          **Example 4:**

          Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

          Output: `0`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


          **Example 5:**

          **Example 11:**

          Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

          Output: `60`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use each
          number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `1*2*4
          = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is
          `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
          number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*5
          = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
          the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5
          = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum product is `60`


          **Example 12:**

          Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

          Output: `-6`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can use
          each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then
          `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
          product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4 =
          12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so the maximum product
          is `20`


          **Example 13:**

          Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

          Output: `1`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`

            then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the
            maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4
            = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so the maximum

            Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
            from the array.

            A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


            **Example 1:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

            `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and then
            `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum
            product is `8` and finally we get `4`

              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then

              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

            description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

            description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 7:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 9:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 10:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`


              **Example 15:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,-1]`

              Output: `-1`

              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then

              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so

              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

            Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
            from the array.

            A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


            **Example 1:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

            Output: `6`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


            **Example 2:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

            Output: `4`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
            use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then `2*2*4
            = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product is
            `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and then
            `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum
            product is `8` and finally we get `4`


            **Example 3:**

            Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

            Output: `0`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


            **Example 4:**

            Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

            Output: `0`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


            **Example 5:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

            Output: `0`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


            **Example 6:**

            Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

            Output: `-2`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`

            Output: `0`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


            **Example 11:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

            Output: `60`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
            `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
            product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
            we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
            = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number
            more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4
            = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum product
            is `60`


            **Example 12:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

            Output: `-6`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and
            then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the
            maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4
            = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so the maximum
            product is `20`


            **Example 13:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

            Output: `1`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


            **Example 14:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

            Output: `-1`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and then
            `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

            description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 7:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 7:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 9:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 10:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`


              **Example 15:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,-1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.

              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

            Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
            from the array.

            A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


            **Example 1:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

            Output: `6`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


            **Example 2:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

            Output: `4`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
            use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then `2*2*4
            = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product is
            `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and then
            `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum
            product is `8` and finally we get `4`


            **Example 3:**

            Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

            Output: `0`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


            **Example 4:**

            Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

            Output: `0`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


            **Example 5:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

            Output: `0`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


            **Example 6:**

            Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

            Output: `-2`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`

            Output: `0`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


            **Example 11:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

            Output: `60`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
            `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
            product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
            we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
            = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number
            more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4
            = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum product
            is `60`


            **Example 12:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

            Output: `-6`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and
            then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the
            maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4
            = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so the maximum
            product is `20`


            **Example 13:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

            Output: `1`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


            **Example 14:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

            Output: `-1`

              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

            description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 7:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              **Example 10:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 7:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 9:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 10:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`


              **Example 15:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,-1]`

              Output: `-1`

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

            then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the
            maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4
            = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so the maximum
            product is `20`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 7:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              **Example 10:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`

              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so

              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 7:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 9:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 10:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

            Output: `-6`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and
            then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the
            maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4
            = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so the maximum
            product is `20`


            **Example 13:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

            Output: `1`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


            **Example 14:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

            Output: `-1`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and then
            `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

            description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`

            description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 7:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 9:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 10:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`


              **Example 15:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,-1]`

              Output: `-1`

              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

            description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 10:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

            then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the
            maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4
            = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so the maximum
            product is `20`

            description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              **Example 10:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then

            description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then

              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

            = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum product
            is `60`


            **Example 12:**

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`

            description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 7:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 9:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

            `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
            product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
            we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
            = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number
            more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4
            = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum product
            is `60`


            **Example 12:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

            Output: `-6`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and
            then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the
            maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4
            = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so the maximum
            product is `20`


            **Example 13:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

            Output: `1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

            description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 7:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 9:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 10:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`


              **Example 15:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,-1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use

              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`

            Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
            from the array.

            A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


            **Example 1:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
            use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then `2*2*4
            = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product is
            `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and then
            `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum
            product is `8` and finally we get `4`

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 7:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 9:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 10:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,-1]`

              Output: `-1`

              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 7:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 9:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 10:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`


              **Example 15:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,-1]`

              Output: `-1`

              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

            `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use

              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum

              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.

              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then

              the maximum product is `20`

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5

              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so

          Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
          from the array.

          A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


          **Example 1:**

          Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

          Output: `6`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`

          Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

          Output: `4`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only use
          each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then `2*2*4
          = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product is `1*2*4
          = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and then `1*(-2)*4
          = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum product is
          `8` and finally we get `4`


          **Example 3:**

          Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

          Output: `0`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

          Output: `60`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use each
          number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `1*2*4
          = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is
          `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
          number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*5
          = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
          the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5
          = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum product is `60`


          **Example 12:**

          Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

          Output: `-6`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can use
          each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then
          `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
          product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4 =
          12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so the maximum product
          is `20`

              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then

              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`

            Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
            from the array.

            A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


            **Example 1:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

            Output: `6`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
            use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then `2*2*4

            `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and then
            `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum
            product is `8` and finally we get `4`


            **Example 3:**

            Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

            Output: `0`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
            `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
            product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
            we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5

            more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4
            = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum product
            is `60`


            **Example 12:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

            Output: `-6`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can use

            then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the
            maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use

              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then

              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

            description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

            `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
            product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
            we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5

            more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4
            = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum product
            is `60`

            Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

            Output: `-6`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and
            then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the
            maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4
            = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so the maximum
            product is `20`

              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 7:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 9:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 10:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`


              **Example 15:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,-1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only

              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each

              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

            description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 7:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 9:**

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`


              **Example 15:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,-1]`

              Output: `-1`

              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`

            Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

            Output: `6`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


            **Example 2:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

            Output: `4`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
            use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then `2*2*4
            = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product is
            `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and then
            `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum
            product is `8` and finally we get `4`


            **Example 3:**

            Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

            Output: `0`

            Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

            Output: `60`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
            `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
            product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
            we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
            = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number
            more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4
            = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum product
            is `60`


            **Example 12:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

            Output: `-6`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and
            then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the
            maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4
            = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so the maximum
            product is `20`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then

              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the

              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

            Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
            from the array.

            A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


            **Example 1:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

            Output: `6`

            Output: `4`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
            use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then `2*2*4
            = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product is
            `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and then
            `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum
            product is `8` and finally we get `4`


            **Example 3:**

            Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

            Output: `0`

            is `60`


            **Example 12:**

            description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 7:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 10:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then

              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each

          Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
          from the array.

          A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


          **Example 1:**

          Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

          Output: `6`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


          **Example 2:**

          Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

          Output: `4`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only use
          each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then `2*2*4
          = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product is `1*2*4
          = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and then `1*(-2)*4
          = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum product is
          `8` and finally we get `4`


          **Example 3:**

          Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

          Output: `0`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


          **Example 4:**

          Output: `60`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use each
          number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `1*2*4
          = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is
          `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
          number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*5
          = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
          the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5
          = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum product is `60`


          **Example 12:**

          Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

          Output: `-6`

          Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can use
          each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then
          `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
          product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4 =
          12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so the maximum product
          is `20`


          **Example 13:**

          Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

          Output: `1`

              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`

              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5

              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.

              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`

              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.

              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

            Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
            from the array.

            A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


            **Example 1:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

            Output: `6`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


            **Example 2:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

            Output: `4`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
            use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then `2*2*4
            = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product is
            `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and then
            `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum
            product is `8` and finally we get `4`


            **Example 3:**

            Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

            Output: `0`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


            **Example 4:**

            Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

            Output: `0`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


            **Example 5:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

            Output: `0`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

            Output: `0`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


            **Example 11:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

            Output: `60`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
            `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
            product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
            we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
            = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number
            more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4
            = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum product
            is `60`


            **Example 12:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

            Output: `-6`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and
            then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the
            maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4
            = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so the maximum
            product is `20`


            **Example 13:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

            Output: `1`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`

            Output: `-1`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and then
            `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`


            **Example 15:**

            Input: `nums = [-1,-1,-1]`

            Output: `-1`

              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

            description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 9:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 10:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 7:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 9:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 10:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`


              **Example 15:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,-1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`

            description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and

            `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
            product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
            we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5

            Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can use
            each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and
            then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the
            maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then `-1*-3*-4
            = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so the maximum
            product is `20`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then

              product is `60`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`

            Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
            from the array.

            A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


            **Example 1:**

            Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

            Output: `6`

            Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
            use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then `2*2*4
            = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product is
            `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and then
            `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the maximum
            product is `8` and finally we get `4`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 5:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,0,-1]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 6:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 7:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 8:**

              Input: `nums = [2,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 9:**

              Input: `nums = [-2,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `-2`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-2`


              **Example 10:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`


              **Example 15:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,-1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-1*1 = 1` and
              then `-1*-1*1 = 1` so the maximum product is `1`

            description: '# Maximum Product Subarray of Size 3

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use

              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each

              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 4:**

              Input: `nums = [0,0,0]`

              Output: `0`

              Output: `0`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `0`


              **Example 11:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`


              **Example 14:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-1,1]`

              Output: `-1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` but since we can
              use each number more than once, the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6`
              and then `-1*-2*-4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so
              the maximum product is `-1*-2*-3 = 6` and then `-1*-2*-5 = 10` and then
              `-1*-3*-4 = 12` and then `-1*-3*-5 = 15` and then `-1*-4*-5 = 20` so
              the maximum product is `20`


              **Example 13:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,1,1]`

              Output: `1`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*1*1 = 1`

              Given an integer array `nums`, return the maximum product of three numbers
              from the array.

              A single number can be used more than once to make a product.


              **Example 1:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

              Output: `6`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*3 = 6`


              **Example 2:**

              Input: `nums = [1,2,-2,4]`

              Output: `4`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `2*2*2 = 8` but since we can only
              use each number once, the maximum product is `2*2*(-2) = 8` and then
              `2*2*4 = 16` but we can only use each number once, so the maximum product
              is `1*2*4 = 8` and then `1*2*(-2) = -4` and then `2*4*(-2) = -16` and
              then `1*(-2)*4 = -8` and then `1*2*2 = 4` and then `2*2*2 = 8` so the
              maximum product is `8` and finally we get `4`


              **Example 3:**

              Input: `nums = [0,-2,3]`

              Output: `0`

              Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`

              Output: `60`

              Explanation: The maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` but since we can use
              each number more than once, the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and
              then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each number more than once, so the maximum
              product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*2*5 = 20` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but
              we can use each number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5
              = 10` and then `2*3*5 = 30` and then `1*2*4 = 8` but we can use each
              number more than once, so the maximum product is `1*2*5 = 10` and then
              `2*3*4 = 24` and then `1*2*5 = 10` and then `2*3*4 = 24` so the maximum
              product is `60`


              **Example 12:**

              Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]`

              Output: `-6`
