  description: '**Non-Locality Preserving Matrix Transformations**


    Given an `n x m` matrix `A`, and two integers `p` and `q`, perform a series of
    transformations on `A` to obtain a new matrix `B`. The transformation consists
    of the following steps:

    - Rotate the top-left `p x p` submatrix of `A` clockwise by 90 degrees.

    - Reflect the bottom-right `(m-p) x (n-q)` submatrix of `A` horizontally.

    - Transpose the remaining `q x q` submatrix in the top-right corner of `A`.


    Return the transformed matrix `B`.
