  description: "# Fractal Forest Problem\n## Description\nYou are given a 2D grid\

    \ that form a fractal pattern.\n\nA fractal pattern is defined as a set of connected\
    \ trees where each tree has at least one neighbor with a different height. Two\
    \ trees are considered neighbors if they share an edge in the grid.\n\n## Example\n\
