  Write a LeetCode-Hard style problem. The problem must be super hard, that even
  a graduate student in computer science will struggle to solve it.
  Do not attempt to generate long, nested dicts. But it will require a very long
  and complicated solution. The execution time should be very short.
  However, it does not need to be super long. It can be shorter, but it must be really hard.
  Please do this in a function way, e.g. provide a function called "main"
  that returns the intended answer.
  You will have to provide this in YAML format, comprising of multiple
  keys and values:
  - "description": a brief description of the question. It should be
                  a string. As all LeetCode problems do, it should have
                  a title, a description, example inputs and outputs,
                  just like what you see in the LeetCode website.
                  It is a string. Write it in markdown format.
  - "code": the code that is the solution to the problem. It should be
           a function called "main" that returns the intended answer.
           It should be in `python3` language. Start without a code block.
           Its "main" function takes in a list of parameters, as the input for
           one test case.
           It is a string.
  - "programming_language": the programming language used in the code.
                            In this case, it should be "python3".
                            It is a string.
  - "inputs": the inputs that tests its functionality. It is a list of
              dictionaries for the kwargs of the function, the test case
              for evaluating an solution, which will put into the "main" function
              to obtain the output. You will need 20 test cases. The keys
              should be parameters of the "main" function, not "args".or "kwargs"!
              If your "main" is "def main(a, b, c):", then the keys should be
              "a", "b", "c". It should contain a lot of edge cases, but only
              require short time to execute.
  Please use the "|" to write multi line strings:
  description: |
    ...
    ...
  code: |
    def main(*args):
        ...
        ...
  programming_language: "python3"
  inputs:
    - {"somekey": "somevalue", "anotherkey": "anothervalue", ...}
    ...
    ...

  Please start right away without any explanation. Please DO NOT put it in a code block.
  Please follow all the instructions or it will crash.
  You must have a "main" function in the code, or it will crash.

  Generate {n_operations} pairs of transform-reverse operations for testing language model consistency.
  Please make sure that these operations should be fit to perform on the root code: "{root_code}".
  Each operation should modify the text and its reverse should restore it.
  Format each line as: "transform operation | reverse operation"
  Example: "split the 'main' function into multiple mini-functions, each only storing partial logic, with cryptic variable names that hide true purpose | merge all mini-functions back into one coherent 'main' function, restoring original descriptive variable names"
  Example: "Utilize advanced concurrent data pipelines within the 'main' function in the 'code' key, splitting tasks via multiprocessing and merging results seamlessly | consolidate all concurrent pipelines back into a single, sequential 'main' function while preserving the original logic"
  Example: "Replace standard control structures within the 'main' function in the 'code' key with complex generators and coroutines that lazily evaluate large datasets | revert the 'main' function to use basic loops and direct evaluations, ensuring behavior stays identical"
  As we all know, there are many ways to transform a piece of code, preserving its functionality, while implementing the same logic in a different way.
  Your operations should be based on what the root code is like, and have transformations that asks the code to be implemented in a different, but valid and equivalent way.
  It is a piece of LeetCode-Hard style problem, but you will not access the description, inputs, and outputs. You will only access the code, which is in `python3` language.
  Please try out what I have suggested above and then come up with your own ideas. Please avoid overly simple operations like "add a period | remove a period" or "capitalize the first letter | lowercase the first letter".
  Please start each line without '- ', '1. ', 'a. ', 'i. ', etc. Keep it simple and clear. Just the operation and its reverse.
  Please make sure in the operation to highlight that the transformation is evaluatee to the \"main\" function in the \"code\" key of the JSON text.
  PLEASE generate EXTREMELY HARD TRANSFORMATIONS that weaker LLMs will struggle with! That is, harder than the examples given above.
  These transformations may struggle and break the edge cases or main functionality.

  For the sake of parsing, please enclose your code within a code block,
  e.g. f"```{programming_language}\n{code}\n```". Please make sure that the code is valid.
  And programming_language is the language for the code. For python code, it should be "python3".
  For JavaScript code, it should be "javascript", etc. Do NOT include anything else.
