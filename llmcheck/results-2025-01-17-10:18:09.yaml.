  description: '**The Harmonious Confluence of Prime Numbers and Binary Search**


    In the realm of prime numbers, there exists a peculiar phenomenon where two prime
    numbers, when multiplied together, yield a product that is a power of 2. These
    prime numbers are known as **harmonious primes**.


    You are given a list of prime numbers, and your task is to find the harmonious
    pair with the smallest product that is a power of 2. If no such pair exists, return
    -1.


    Note that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive
    divisors other than 1 and itself.


    Example 1:

    Input: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

    Output: 2

    Explanation: The harmonious pair with the smallest product that is a power of
    2 is (2, 2), which has a product of 4, which is 2^2.


    Example 2:

    Input: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]

    Output: 17

    Explanation: The harmonious pair with the smallest product that is a power of
    2 is (17, 1), which is not listed in the input, but we know that 17 is a prime
    number and 1 is not, but we can find a pair (17, 1) in the list of prime numbers
    given, which is (2, 17) or (17, 2), which are listed, but we can see that 2 *
    17 = 34 which is not 2^x, so we need to try another pair (2, 2) which is listed,
    and 2 * 2 = 4 which is 2^2.


    Example 3:

    Input: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]

    Output: -1

    Explanation: There is no harmonious pair in the list with a product that is a
    power of 2.

              Search**


              In the realm of prime numbers, there exists a peculiar phenomenon where
              two prime numbers, when multiplied together, yield a product that is
              a power of 2. These prime numbers are known as **harmonious primes**.


              You are given a list of prime numbers, and your task is to find the
              harmonious pair with the smallest product that is a power of 2. If no
              such pair exists, return -1.


              Note that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has
              no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.


              Example 1:

              Input: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

              Output: 2

              Explanation: The harmonious pair with the smallest product that is a
              power of 2 is (2, 2), which has a product of 4, which is 2^2.


              Example 2:

              Input: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]

              Output: 17

              Explanation: The harmonious pair with the smallest product that is a
              power of 2 is (17, 1), which is not listed in the input, but we know
              that 17 is a prime number and 1 is not, but we can find a pair (17,
              1) in the list of prime numbers given, which is (2, 17) or (17, 2),
              which are listed, but we can see that 2 * 17 = 34 which is not 2^x,
              so we need to try another pair (2, 2) which is listed, and 2 * 2 = 4
              which is 2^2.


              Example 3:

              Input: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]

              Output: -1

              Explanation: There is no harmonious pair in the list with a product
              that is a power of 2.

          return -1.


          Note that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no
          positive divisors other than 1 and itself.


          Example 1:

          Input: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

          Output: 2

          Explanation: The harmonious pair with the smallest product that is a power
          of 2 is (2, 2), which has a product of 4, which is 2^2.


          Example 2:

          Input: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]

          Output: 17

          Explanation: The harmonious pair with the smallest product that is a power
          of 2 is (17, 1), which is not listed in the input, but we know that 17 is
          a prime number and 1 is not, but we can find a pair (17, 1) in the list
          of prime numbers given, which is (2, 17) or (17, 2), which are listed, but
          we can see that 2 * 17 = 34 which is not 2^x, so we need to try another
          pair (2, 2) which is listed, and 2 * 2 = 4 which is 2^2.


          Example 3:

          Input: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]

          Output: -1

          Explanation: There is no harmonious pair in the list with a product that
          is a power of 2.

              In the realm of prime numbers, there exists a peculiar phenomenon where
              two prime numbers, when multiplied together, yield a product that is
              a power of 2. These prime numbers are known as **harmonious primes**.


              You are given a list of prime numbers, and your task is to find the
              harmonious pair with the smallest product that is a power of 2. If no
              such pair exists, return -1.


              Note that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has
              no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.


              Example 1:

              Input: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

              Output: 2

              Explanation: The harmonious pair with the smallest product that is a
              power of 2 is (2, 2), which has a product of 4, which is 2^2.


              Example 2:

              Input: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]

              Output: 17

              Explanation: The harmonious pair with the smallest product that is a
              power of 2 is (17, 1), which is not listed in the input, but we know
              that 17 is a prime number and 1 is not, but we can find a pair (17,
              1) in the list of prime numbers given, which is (2, 17) or (17, 2),
              which are listed, but we can see that 2 * 17 = 34 which is not 2^x,
              so we need to try another pair (2, 2) which is listed, and 2 * 2 = 4
              which is 2^2.

              harmonious pair with the smallest product that is a power of 2. If no
              such pair exists, return -1.


              Note that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has
              no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.


              Example 1:

              Input: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

              Output: 2

              Explanation: The harmonious pair with the smallest product that is a
              power of 2 is (2, 2), which has a product of 4, which is 2^2.


              Example 2:

              Input: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]

              Output: 17

              Explanation: The harmonious pair with the smallest product that is a
              power of 2 is (17, 1), which is not listed in the input, but we know
              that 17 is a prime number and 1 is not, but we can find a pair (17,
              1) in the list of prime numbers given, which is (2, 17) or (17, 2),
              which are listed, but we can see that 2 * 17 = 34 which is not 2^x,
              so we need to try another pair (2, 2) which is listed, and 2 * 2 = 4
              which is 2^2.


              Example 3:

              Input: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]

              Output: -1

              Explanation: There is no harmonious pair in the list with a product
              that is a power of 2.

              Search**


              In the realm of prime numbers, there exists a peculiar phenomenon where
              two prime numbers, when multiplied together, yield a product that is
              a power of 2. These prime numbers are known as **harmonious primes**.


              You are given a list of prime numbers, and your task is to find the
              harmonious pair with the smallest product that is a power of 2. If no
              such pair exists, return -1.


              Note that a prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has
              no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.


              Example 1:

              Input: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13]

              Output: 2

              Explanation: The harmonious pair with the smallest product that is a
              power of 2 is (2, 2), which has a product of 4, which is 2^2.


              Example 2:

              Input: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]

              Output: 17

              Explanation: The harmonious pair with the smallest product that is a
              power of 2 is (17, 1), which is not listed in the input, but we know
              that 17 is a prime number and 1 is not, but we can find a pair (17,
              1) in the list of prime numbers given, which is (2, 17) or (17, 2),
              which are listed, but we can see that 2 * 17 = 34 which is not 2^x,
              so we need to try another pair (2, 2) which is listed, and 2 * 2 = 4
              which is 2^2.


              Example 3:

              Input: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]

              Output: -1

              Explanation: There is no harmonious pair in the list with a product
              that is a power of 2.
