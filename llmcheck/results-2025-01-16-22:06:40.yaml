  description: "## Problem: Asynchronous Prime Path Finder\n\nGiven a graph represented\
    \ as an adjacency list, where each node is an integer and edges represent connections\
    \ between these integers, your task is to find the longest path that can be formed\
    \ by visiting prime numbers only. Additionally, the graph traversal must be performed\
    \ asynchronously, simulating a multithreaded environment where each thread explores\
    \ a different starting prime number. \n\nYou should return the length of the longest\
    \ path found. If no prime path exists, return 0. \n\nThe graph is guaranteed to\
