  description: '**Fractal Tree Reconstruction**

    ==========


    Given a list of `n` points in a 2D space and an integer `k`, reconstruct a fractal
    tree from the given points.

    The tree is constructed by iterating through each point, drawing a line to its
    closest neighbor, and recursively

    subdividing the triangle formed by this line and the two lines connecting the
    current point to its neighbors.

          Given a list of `n` points in a 2D space and an integer `k`, reconstruct
          a fractal tree from the given points.

          The tree is constructed by iterating through each point, drawing a line
          to its closest neighbor, and recursively
